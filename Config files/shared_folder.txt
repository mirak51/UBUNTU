A shared folder can be created on the host using the VirtualBox GUI or via vboxmanage. For example, to create a shared folder called myshare under /mnt/bsdboxshare for the VM named BSDBox, run:

# vboxmanage sharedfolder add 'BSDBox' --name myshare --hostpath /mnt/bsdboxshare




Note that the shared folder name must not contain spaces. Mount the shared folder from within the guest system like this:

# mount_vboxvfs -w myshare /mnt
